# python-rename-pdfs
Script used to renamed PDF files from embedded title metadata

## Purpose
I thought a script like this would be useful for auto-renaming a bunch of various PDFs I have accumlated over time.  Simply uploading them to Google Books is kind of a mess if the files aren't name properly, so I thought using a script to rename the files to the title in the PDF metadata would help.  Unfortunately, I've found that often the metadata is properly filled out, this particular PDF parsing library throws a lot of exceptions on the PDFs in my collection, so I am abandoning this venture.
